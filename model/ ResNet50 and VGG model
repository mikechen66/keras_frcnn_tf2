Notes for the ResNet50 model. 

Please create a new folder named model under keras_frcnn. It will work as a directory for regular usage. 

For the script of test_frcnn_kitti, pleae download the following models(pre-trained weights). 

resnet50_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
resnet50_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5

vgg19_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels.h5
vgg19_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5
